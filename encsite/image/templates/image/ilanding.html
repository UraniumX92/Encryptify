    Image encryption is a procedure which converts plain image to an encrypted image by employing a secret key. The decryption process decrypts the cipher image into the original image by employing the same key. <br>
    Image encryption can provide security to your multimedia data by changing their pixel values and/or locations using different algorithms. <br>
    Encriptify gives you three options to encrypt your images: <br>
    Simple encryption, Text-to-image and Steganography of images. <br>
    Simple encryption is a feature that encrypts your image with a password or a key without changing its format. <br>
    Text-to-image is a feature that turns your text into an image after encrypting it with a password or a key. <br>
    This makes it more difficult for anyone to decode your message without knowing the key. <br>
    Steganography is a feature that hides your encrypted text within another image that you choose. <br>
    This makes it almost impossible for anyone to notice or reveal your message without knowing the key and the original image. <br>
    To use these features, just select one of the features from the buttons below and follow the steps. You will need to upload your image, enter a password or a key to encrypt or decrypt your image.<br>
    You can download your encrypted/decrypted images as files.<br>
    Encriptify is simple and secure.<br>
    Give it a try and have fun!<br>
